## Concurl

The concurl is just a simple cli tool created to make multiple http requests concurrently. Built using go and [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra). 
Made with ❤️ 

### How To Use

Checkout the code and run `go install` from inside the directory. Once you get binary simply run `concurl --help` to learn more about the tool :)
